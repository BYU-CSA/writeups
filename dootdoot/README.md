## Writeup
When you go to the link, one of the comments says `the flag is in the yellow text, and occurs once in every instance of the yellow text`. The video was almost 9 hours total in length, but I knew I'd only have to scour one instance of the yellow text. I considered various ways of approaching it, including integrating some OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program in YouTube and have it tell me all the text so I could do a simple grep search. However, the rolling text was Star Wars-style (so slanted), plus I wasn't quite sure how to integrate it, so I just went for it. Luckily, I found the text about 10 minutes in!

## Real-World Application
I think the biggest real-world application for this is that sometimes, nothing beats just grinding. I could've found a way to integrate OCR into it and automate the process, but it honestly was much quicker watching the video and skipping every 5 seconds.
