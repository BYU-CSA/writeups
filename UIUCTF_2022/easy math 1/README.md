## Writeup
This pwn problem was pretty interesting and not too difficult to implement. Once you signed in to the server using the provided credentials, you were greeted with four challenge files:

```
$ ssh ctf@easy-math.chal.uiuc.tf
ctf@easy-math.chal.uiuc.tf's password:
== proof-of-work: disabled ==
ctf@test-center:~$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 ctf   ctf     265 Jul 30 18:48 README
-r-sr-xr-x 1 admin admin 13296 Jul 30 18:50 easy-math
-rw-r--r-- 1 ctf   ctf    1348 Jul 29 09:01 easy-math.c
-r-------- 1 admin admin   327 Jul 29 09:01 flag
ctf@test-center:~$ cat flag
cat: flag: Permission denied
ctf@test-center:~$
```

The `README` contained some information about what programs were installed on the Ubuntu 18.04 instance to help with on-prem solve scripts. The `flag` file was only readable by the `admin` user. Then, the source code and binary for `easy-math` were provided. The whole source code can be found [here](easy-math.c), but the important parts are below:

```c
#define MATH_PROBLEMS 10000

int take_test() {
  int urand = open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY);
  if (!urand) return 1;
  unsigned char urand_byte;

  for (int i=0; i<MATH_PROBLEMS; i++) {
    if (read(urand, &urand_byte, 1) != 1) return 1;
    int a = urand_byte & 0xf;
    int b = urand_byte >> 4;
    printf("Question %d: %d * %d = ", i+1, a, b);

    int ans;
    if (scanf("%d", &ans) != 1) return 1;
    if (ans != a * b) return 1;
  }

  close(urand);
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  setreuid(geteuid(), getuid());
  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

  // ...

  if (take_test()) {
    printf("You have failed the test.\n");
    return 1;
  }

  setreuid(getuid(), getuid());
  system("cat /home/ctf/flag");
  return 0;
}
```

The gist of this script is that 10,000 simple math problems will be thrown at you, and if all of them are solved correctly, then the flag will be printed out. However, this binary wasn't accessible through a netcat listener, but rather when signed in to the SSH server. There were two approaches I could take - develop a script that would sign in to SSH and answer all the problems, or create a script on the server that would solve it for me. I was lazy, so I decided to take the first route. 

My solve script ([math.py](math.py)) hinged on the Python library [pexpect](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This library allowed you to run system commands, capture the output, and send custom input dynamically by using the `spawn()`, `expect()`, and `sendline()` commands. It SSHed into the system, ran the executable, and captured both numbers. It then passed it into eval and sent the result to the program through the SSH tunnel. It printed out each question it solved and then the flag:

```
$ python3 math.py
Question 1: 13 * 3 = 39
Question 2: 6 * 0 = 0
Question 3: 10 * 9 = 90
Question 4: 7 * 15 = 105
Question 5: 14 * 5 = 70
Question 6: 13 * 12 = 156
...
Question 9999: 15 * 8 = 120
Question 10000: 11 * 9 = 99
Flag!
Nice job! Now, the question is, did you do it the fun way, or by hiding behind your ssh client?

Part 1 flag:
uiuctf{now do it the fun way :D}

To solve part 2, use `ssh ctf-part-2@easy-math.chal.uiuc.tf` (password is still ctf)
This time, your input is sent in live, but you don't get any output until after your shell exits.
ctf@test-center:~$
```

**Flag:** `uiuctf{now do it the fun way :D}`
